A superhero roguelike, covers the "career" of a superhero, from creation until
inevitable end or retirement. Superhero is used loosely in this case, as a
person could just as easily become a villain.


POWERS:
-------

A superhero of course has an array of super powers. Some powers should be unique
to individual heros (primary powers), others are common to all heros
(secondary powers), and non-playable but sometimes helpful powers (tertiary
powers)

A list of proposed primary powers:
- Flight
- Telekenisis (a force push/pull)
- Telekenisis (extended punches, kicks etc)
- Invisibility
- Elemental manipulation (fire, earth, wind, water...)
- Intelligence (gadgetry and traps)
- Teleportation
- Cloning
- Physical mutation (blade hands, iron skin, etc)
- Energy blast
- Force field
- Power mimicry
- Size increase

A list of proposed secondary powers:
- Healing Factor (health regen)
- Speed (attack/movement)
- Strength (physical attack damage)
- Will (mental attack damage)
- Various damage resistances

A list of proposed tertiary powers:
- Telepathy
- Super hearing
- Super sight
- Intelligence (inventing gadgets, decoding messages/languages)

All powers that a hero has may not be active at once (a level up sort of
process may unlock new powers, or a scheduled in game event), and proficiency
in powers increases over time


ORIGINS:
--------

Origins dictate the initial powers (or group of powers) that a hero has, and
is a way for the player to influence original buildout. Some origins may allow
for more powers at the expense of increasing individual power strength or vice
versa. Origins also dictate some of the behind the scenes statistics such as
"experience Ngain" and resistances.

Significant events in the hero's quest may present the choice of adding new
powers.

Proposed origins:
- Mutation
- Alien raised on earth
- Cyborg
- Medical experimentation
- Accidental radiation exposure
- Traumatic childhood event
- Stolen from another hero


STORY/GAME SEQUENCE:
--------------------

Because this game is intended to be a "roguelike", there should be no set story,
instead there should be a "build your own" sort of vibe, where ultimate success
can range from "forged the world into a peaceful utopia" to "dominated the 
populus for years under an iron will" (both not the "most good" ending).

A list of potential events can occur in any playthrough, after playing some
number and reaching a "final conflict" the game ends for that character, having
bested all that could be encountered at that time. Characters making it to this
point enter infamy, and could be mentioned (or even encountered) in subsequent
playthroughs.

Proposed events (and outcomes):
- Origin
  * Obtain superpowers, decide to support or forgo any organizations
- Alien invasion
  * Bring peace after initial attack
  * Destroy alien invasion force completely as a message to future forces
  * Convince alien force to assist with later missions, if applicable
- Natural Disaster (hurricane, tsunami, volcano):
  * Avert the disaster from population centers
  * Save as many citizens directly
  * Maximize damage to area for self-gain
- Small time crime (bank robbery, hostage situation, etc.):
  * Help bring criminals to justice
  * Kill criminals in the act
    + Possibly complete crime for own gain
  * Assist criminals escaping the law
- City takeover:
  * Prevent takeover in progress, or liberate city after takeover has already
    occured
    + Bring offenders to justice
    + Kill offenders
  * Takeover innocent city single handedly
- Rogue villan or hero (a boss style battle):
  * Destroy one or more super powers with the help of zero or more others

Events could be arranged on a city map, after some percentage of the map is
converted to an alliance (good, evil, neutral, etc) a final battle would be
enabled/initiated that would dictate the success atkeeping the city in that
alliance. Game ends after the battle.

A more complex set of critera could be met for game end, enabling endings for
more than just "good" or "evil"
